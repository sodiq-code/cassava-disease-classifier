# 📱 Access Your CassavaDoc App

## ✅ **Expo Server is Running!**

I can see multiple Expo servers are running in the background. Here's how to access your app:

## 🎯 **Method 1: Direct QR Code Access**

### **Option A: Expo Go App (Recommended)**
1. **Install Expo Go** on your phone:
   - Android: [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
   - iPhone: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)

2. **Open Expo Go** and scan this QR code:
   ```
   The QR code should be visible in your Cursor terminal where you ran npm start
   ```

3. **Alternative - Manual URL Entry:**
   - Open Expo Go app
   - Tap "Enter URL manually"
   - Enter: `exp://localhost:19000` or check terminal for exact URL

### **Option B: Web Browser Testing**
Since servers are running, you can also test in browser:
- Open: `http://localhost:19006` 
- Or: `http://localhost:8081`

## 🔧 **If QR Code Not Visible**

Run this in a new terminal tab:
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

Then look for output like:
```
› Metro waiting on exp://192.168.x.x:19000
› Scan the QR code above with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)

████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████
████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████
████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████
```

## 📱 **Expected Experience**

Once you scan the QR code:

1. **App Loading**: "Loading CassavaDoc..." (30-60 seconds first time)
2. **Home Screen**: Beautiful green interface with "🌿 CassavaDoc" header
3. **Test Camera**: Tap "Take Photo" → camera opens
4. **Test ML**: Take any plant photo → get real disease prediction
5. **Verify API**: Look for "🌐 Online (API)" in results
